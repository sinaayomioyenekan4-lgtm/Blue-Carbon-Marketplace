# 🌊 Blue Carbon Marketplace

Welcome to the decentralized marketplace for blue carbon credits! This Web3 project leverages the Stacks blockchain to enable transparent trading of carbon credits generated from ocean conservation efforts, such as protecting mangroves, seagrasses, and salt marshes. By connecting conservation projects with buyers (e.g., corporations offsetting emissions), it directly supports coastal communities through automated fund distribution, tackling real-world problems like climate change, biodiversity loss, and economic inequality in vulnerable regions.

## ✨ Features
🌍 Register and verify ocean conservation projects  
💰 Mint blue carbon credits based on verified sequestration data  
📈 Trade credits in a decentralized marketplace with low fees  
🤝 Automatic revenue sharing with coastal communities  
🔒 Secure escrow for peer-to-peer transactions  
📊 Oracle integration for real-world verification (e.g., satellite data on ecosystem health)  
🏆 Governance for community-driven decisions on project approvals  
🔄 Staking mechanism to incentivize long-term holding and conservation support  
📝 Immutable records for compliance and auditing  

## 🛠 How It Works
**For Project Owners (Coastal Communities or NGOs)**  
- Register your conservation project with details like location, ecosystem type, and expected carbon sequestration.  
- Submit verification data (e.g., via oracles) to mint blue carbon credits.  
- List credits for sale on the marketplace, with a portion of proceeds automatically directed to community funds.  

**For Buyers (Corporations or Individuals)**  
- Browse and purchase blue carbon credits to offset emissions.  
- Use escrow for secure trades—funds release only after confirmation.  
- Stake credits to earn rewards and support ongoing conservation.  

**For Verifiers and Auditors**  
- Query project details and credit minting history for transparency.  
- Participate in governance to vote on project validations.  

That's it! A fully decentralized system ensuring credits are genuine, trades are fair, and communities benefit directly.

## 📚 Smart Contracts
This project is built using Clarity on the Stacks blockchain and involves 8 smart contracts for modularity, security, and scalability:

1. **CarbonCreditToken.clar**: An SIP-10 compliant fungible token contract for representing blue carbon credits. Handles minting, burning, and transfers.  
2. **ProjectRegistry.clar**: Manages registration of conservation projects, storing metadata like location, type, and owner details. Prevents duplicates and allows updates.  
3. **CreditMinter.clar**: Logic for minting credits based on verified data. Integrates with oracles to calculate sequestration amounts.  
4. **Marketplace.clar**: Decentralized exchange for listing, buying, and selling credits. Includes order matching and fee collection.  
5. **Escrow.clar**: Secure escrow service for trades, holding funds until both parties confirm or disputes are resolved.  
6. **OracleVerifier.clar**: Interfaces with external oracles to fetch and validate real-world data (e.g., carbon sequestration metrics from satellite imagery).  
7. **CommunityFund.clar**: Distributes a percentage of transaction fees and sales to project owners and coastal communities via automated payouts.  
8. **Governance.clar**: DAO-like contract for voting on project approvals, parameter changes, and fund allocations using staked tokens.

## 🚀 Getting Started
- Clone the repo and deploy contracts using the Clarity dev tools.  
- Test on Stacks testnet: Start by registering a mock project and minting credits.  
- Integrate with wallets like Hiro for user interactions.
